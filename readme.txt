Manage and display advanced user profiles on your website.

== Description ==

This plugin allows for management of user public profiles with a lot of customizability.

In the dashboard under Profiles->Settings, administrators can:

* Build a form for users to fill out, choosing which fields to include and how to arrange them, via a straightforward drag and drop interface.
* Add taxonomies to group and filter profiles
* Design a page to display user information
* Design a separate list view when listing multiple users
* Create additional fields that can be added to the profile form and page.
* Manage, create and delete user profiles

Users can edit their profile under Users->Public Profile, where they'll be presented with
the form you created.

Everything can be styled with CSS

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file into wp-content/plugins/ in your WordPress installation
2. Go to plugins page to activate

== Usage ==

The plugin will generate pages for individual profiles as well as for lists of people.

For further flexibility you can use the [profilelist] and [profile] shortcodes to display profiles anywhere on a site.

=[profilelist] shortcode=

[profilelist] by default shows all profiles in list view format

Filtering by taxonomy:
[profilelist {taxonomyname} = "{taxonomyvalue}"] shows profiles that meet the specified criteria

You can specify multiple taxonomies to filter by, by default then only profiles that meet ALL the specified criteria will be displayed. Alternatively you can also add query="or" to the shortcode to show profiles meeting at least one of the criterias.

Displaying more details:
use display="full" to show full profiles, or display="name" to only shows names. Default behaviour shows the list view as set in the settings.

Show a specific set of people:
[profilelist include="id, id2, id3..."]
Displays the people with the corresponding id

=[profile] shortcode=

With this shortcode you can display a single profile. (This can also be accomplished with the [profilelist] shortcode with the right parameters, but this is a more straightforward option)

Simply use [profile person="slug"] where slug is usually firstname-lastname.

By default the full view will be shown, but you can set display="list" instead to show the list view.
