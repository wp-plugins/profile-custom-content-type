Manage and display advanced user profiles on your website.

== Description ==

This plugin allows for management of user public profiles with a lot of customizability.

In the dashboard under Profiles->Settings, administrators can:

* Build a form for users to fill out, choosing which fields to include and how to arrange them, via a straightforward drag and drop interface.
* Add taxonomies to group and filter profiles
* Design a page to display user information
* Design a separate list view when listing multiple users
* Create additional fields that can be added to the profile form and page.
* Manage, create and delete user profiles

Users can edit their profile under Users->Public Profile, where they'll be presented with
the form you created.

Everything can be styled with CSS

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file into wp-content/plugins/ in your WordPress installation
2. Go to plugins page to activate
3. Recommended: Some minor changes to theme files (archive.php, search.php, taxonomy.php) to accommodate profile cct features (see "Usage" for details)

The plugin (optionally) makes use of jQuery UI tabs so you'll need to grab some CSS for that if your theme doesn't already have it and you want tabbed content on profile pages.
See http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ to find or create a style for the tabs

== Usage ==

The plugin will generate pages for individual profiles as well as for lists of people.

The profile form your users will fill out can be fully customized in Profiles->Settings, as well as how profiles are displayed on your site.

Additional information on this customization is available at http://wiki.ubc.ca/Documentation:UBC_Content_Management_System/Managing_People_Profiles_and_Directories

= Archive Pages =

By default you can see a list of profiles on your site at example.com/your-site-path/person

To display filtering/searching controls on the archive page you have three options:
1. modify your taxonomy.php template and archive.php (or archive-profile_cct.php) in your theme folder and include the line <?php do_action("profile_cct_display_archive_controls"); ?> where you want the controls to appear. The plugin will function fine without this but it won't be as easy for your users to search/filter/browse profiles. (The controls can be customized as well on the Settings page)
2. Use the Profile navigation widget. It'll include the fields you specify in the settings page.
3. Use the [profilenavigation] shortcode (More info in the shortcode section of this document.

**Note: Make sure you enable some navigation elements in the Profiles->Settings page under the Settings tab**


In addition, you may want to customize the search results page for profile_cct posts and only display the_excerpt() in the loop (the_excerpt() will output the list view as set on the profile settings page)

See the examples folder for examples of these theme modifications

For other uses you can use the [profilelist] and [profile] shortcodes to display profiles anywhere on a site.

= [profilelist] shortcode =

[profilelist] by default shows all profiles in list view format

Filtering by taxonomy:
[profilelist {taxonomyname} = "{taxonomyvalue}"] shows profiles that meet the specified criteria

You can specify multiple taxonomies to filter by, by default then only profiles that meet ALL the specified criteria will be displayed. Alternatively you can also add query="or" to the shortcode to show profiles meeting at least one of the criterias.

Filtering by letter:
[profilelist letter="a"] returns all profiles where last name starts with letter 'a'.

Ordering results:
[profilelist orderby = orderfield] where 'orderfield' is either first_name, last_name, or date. By default it will use the manual ordering specified on the Profiles->Order Profiles page
You can also show results in descending order, eg [profilelist orderby='first_name' order='desc']


Displaying more details:
use display="full" to show full profiles, or display="name" to only shows names. Default behaviour shows the list view as set in the settings.


Show a specific set of people:
[profilelist include="id, id2, id3..."]
Displays the people with the corresponding id

= [profile] shortcode =

With this shortcode you can display a single profile. (This can also be accomplished with the [profilelist] shortcode with the right parameters, but this is a more straightforward option)

Simply use [profile person="slug"] where slug is usually firstname-lastname.

By default the full view will be shown, but you can set display="list" instead to show the list view.

= [profilesearch] shortcode =

Display a search box (with jquery-ui Autocomplete) to search for profiles by name

= [profilenavigation] shortcode =

Displays profile navigation. If no parameters are supplied it'll rely on the options set in the settings page. If at least one parameter is supplied then the global settings will be ignored
display_searchbox=true to show the search box
display_alphabet=true to show the letter list
display_orderby=true to show the orderby field
display_tax="comma separated list of taxonomies" to show dropdowns to filter by those taxonomies.

eg [profilenavigation display_searchbox="true" display_tax="location, position"] will show a searchbox as well as two dropdown menus to filter by the two specified taxonomies
